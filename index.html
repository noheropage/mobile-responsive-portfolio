            My name is Page Black and for the last five years I've been working as a registered nurse at Swedish Medical Center. 
            While most of my shifts are spent treating patients and collaborating with various health professionals, I 
            also serve in leadership roles (i.e. Charge Nurse and Unit Based Education Champion) and committees (i.e. Evidence 
            Based Practice Council and Shared Leadership). It's through this work I discovered the importance (and my love) of 
            web development.   
        </p>
        <p>
            My coworkers always saw me as "the computer guy" so it was natural to gravitate towards tech roles. When Swedish 
            changed their systems over to a Microsoft platform, I was happy to assist my groups in adopting the new technologies. 
            I migrated the old information into several Share Point and Yammer sites while also implementing policies to improve 
            communication both within and without the system. As a bedside nurse I know how difficult it can be to find information 
            crucial to patient care in a timely manner and saw how the right technology could be leveraged to make it easier. Now 
            I'm working full time to add tech skills to my nursing repertoire and hopefully help the world along the way.
        </p>

            When my head isn't buried in a book or computer screen, you'll find me outside. I've got a 15-year-old poodle who 
            demands lengthy walks and playtimes. When she lets me take a break, I try to get in some run time (up to 10k!) or 
            take the kayak out on Lake Washington. Of course, this is all just to help keep me busy until I can get back to my 
            true passions: traveling and scuba diving. I'll always be amazed with all the wonder that surrounds us!
        </p>
